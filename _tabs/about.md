Hey there! I'm Dean, a Cyber Security Analyst with a passion for both **red team and blue team** operations. Whether I’m defending against live threats in an **incident response engagement** or breaking into a CTF challenge, I thrive on the problem-solving and creativity that cybersecurity demands.  

This blog is my space to document my **cyber journey**—from **CTF write-ups** and **homelab experiments** to deep dives into **digital forensics, malware analysis, and threat hunting**.  

## My Background  

I currently work in **cybersecurity operations and incident response**, where I lead investigations, hunt down adversaries, and help organizations strengthen their defenses. My experience spans across **managed security services (MSSP), digital forensics, and endpoint detection & response (EDR)**.  

I’ve earned certifications like the **GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH), eJPT, and Security+**, and I continually sharpen my skills through **HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and cybersecurity competitions**. I also have a background in digital forensics, where I’ve worked on legal cases involving cyber investigations.  

## My Cyber Lab  

Right now, my **homelab is a work in progress**, but it previously included:  
- A **SIEM environment** for monitoring attacks and analyzing logs  
- An **attack/defense lab** for practicing offensive and defensive security techniques  

As I rebuild my lab, I’ll be documenting the process, sharing configurations, and posting lessons learned.  

## CTFs & Research  

I split my CTF time between **offensive (red team) challenges** and **defensive (blue team) investigations**. I’m always looking to improve my **malware analysis, adversary simulation, and forensic skills**, and CTFs provide a great way to learn in a high-pressure environment.  

## Career Goals  

My ultimate goal is to **blend offensive and defensive security into a true purple team role**—leveraging **red team tactics to strengthen blue team defenses**. I believe that by understanding how attackers operate and directly applying that knowledge to detection engineering, threat hunting, and adversary simulation, I can have the greatest impact on the companies I work with.  

I aim to contribute to **building more resilient security programs, fine-tuning detection capabilities, and mentoring others on both sides of the cyber battlefield**. By combining the **mindset of an attacker with the vigilance of a defender**, I strive to make security more effective, proactive, and adaptable.  

This blog is as much for me as it is for anyone else looking to get into the field—so feel free to follow along as I explore, experiment, and grow in cybersecurity!
